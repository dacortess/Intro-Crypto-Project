## 1. Overview

This document details the implementation of the `CryptoAnalysisSection` component, a React component that performs cryptanalysis on user-provided text using either the Hill cipher or the Vigenère cipher methods.  The component utilizes a backend function (`analyzeText`) to perform the analysis and displays the results to the user.

## 2. Component Structure

The `CryptoAnalysisSection` component is composed of the following elements:

* **Input Area:** A textarea for the user to input the text to be analyzed.
* **Method Selection:** A select dropdown allowing the user to choose between "Hill Cipher (Coincidence Index)" and "Vigenère Cipher (Coincidence Index)" analysis methods.
* **Analyze Button:** A button that triggers the analysis process. The button displays "Analyzing..." while the analysis is in progress.
* **Output Area:** Displays the analysis results, including the most probable deciphered text and a list of all possible deciphered words with their corresponding keys.

The component uses the following React hooks:

* `useState`: Manages the component's state, including input text (`inputText`), selected analysis method (`method`), analysis output (`outputText`), and loading indicator (`isLoading`).
* `useToast`:  For displaying success and error messages to the user.


## 3. `handleAnalyze` Function

The core logic of the component resides in the `handleAnalyze` function. This asynchronous function performs the following steps:

1. **Input Validation:** Checks if the user has provided input text and selected an analysis method. If not, it displays an error toast message using `useToast` and returns.

2. **Analysis Execution:**  Sets `isLoading` to `true` to indicate the analysis is in progress. It then calls the backend function `analyzeText` with the input text and selected method.

3. **Response Handling:**
    * **Parsing:** The response from `analyzeText` is expected to be a JSON string representing an array: `[[["word","key"],...], "mostProbable"]`.  The code attempts to parse this JSON.
    * **Success:** If parsing is successful, the data is structured into an `AnalysisResult` object and set to `outputText`.  A success toast message is shown.
    * **Parsing Failure:** If parsing fails (e.g., due to an unexpected response format from the backend), the function treats the `result` as a simple string, setting `possibleWords` to an empty array and `mostProbable` to the raw `result`. A success toast message is displayed in this scenario also.

4. **Error Handling:** A `catch` block handles potential errors during the analysis process.  If an error occurs, an error toast message is displayed.

5. **Loading State Update:** Finally, `isLoading` is set back to `false` regardless of success or failure, using a `finally` block.

**Algorithm Details (Implied):** The specific algorithms used by the `analyzeText` function (Hill cipher and Vigenère cipher with coincidence index) are not detailed within this component's code.  The documentation for `analyzeText` should provide details on these algorithms.  This component focuses on handling user interaction, displaying results, and managing error conditions.

## 4. Data Structures

The component uses the following interfaces:

| Interface Name       | Description                                                                     | Fields                               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `PossibleWord`       | Represents a possible word and its corresponding decryption key.                | `word` (string), `key` (string)       |
| `AnalysisResult`     | Represents the complete analysis result.                                        | `possibleWords` (`PossibleWord`[]), `mostProbable` (string) |


The `ANALYSIS_METHODS` constant defines the available analysis methods:

| Value    | Label                       |
|----------|----------------------------|
| `"hill"` | Hill Cipher (Coincidence Index) |
| `"vigenere"` | Vigenère Cipher (Coincidence Index) |


## 5. Error Handling and User Feedback

The component incorporates robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms:

* **Input Validation:**  Checks for missing input text and analysis method selection, displaying appropriate error messages.
* **Backend Error Handling:** Catches errors during the `analyzeText` call and displays a generic error message.
* **Response Parsing Error Handling:**  Specifically handles JSON parsing errors to gracefully present results even if the backend response is not in the expected format.
* **Toast Notifications:** Uses `useToast` to provide immediate visual feedback to the user about the success or failure of the analysis.
